It's not that I want things to be boring. I want to still make cool things that I'm proud of
but I enjoy adding some discipline and/or constraints.   
<br>
In photography I use constraints where I see fit to make capturing an image mean more to me.
I don't have the fanciest gear.  My digital camera is pretty nice but compared to other 
digital cameras, I'd say it's pretty minimal.  
<br>
When I'm developing software I use discipline to prevent myself from over engineering and 
wasting time making something that's the "the greatest ever" and instead make something that
works.  Which in the end, actually makes it "the greatest ever".
