Hello! I'm Mike, and welcome to my corner of the internet - a mosaic of everything I love.

At heart, I'm an explorer, both geographically and intellectually. I have a deep passion for traveling, whether it's a solo adventure or journeys shared with my wife. Each trip is an opportunity to capture memories with my camera.  I enjoy documenting the essence of these experiences. Photography isn't just a hobby; it's how I see and remember the world.

My professional journey has been quite the odyssey. I ventured into the realm of programming, where I delved into the fascinating world of robotics. The experience was enriching, but life had other plans, leading me back to the oil & gas industry as a pipeline weld inspector. While it might seem like a departure from tech, it's just another chapter in my story.

But there's more to me than just my job. I've always found solace in writing. It's not just about stringing words together; it's about weaving narratives that resonate. So, I decided to bring my musings and stories here, creating a space that's authentically mine, away from the clamor of social media.

This website is more than a blog or a portfolio; it's a digital collection of my journeys, ideas, and creations. It's where I'll be sharing my travel tales, insights from my tech and industry experiences, and, of course, my thoughts â€“ a blend of reflections, stories, and perhaps some musings on the everyday.

I'm not a fan of social media's fleeting interactions, so this site is where you'll find the real, unfiltered me. However, conversation and connection are still at the heart of what I hope to build here. If you want to chat, share ideas, or just say hello, don't hesitate to drop an email or use the contact form on this page.  

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find a piece of my world that resonates with yours.
