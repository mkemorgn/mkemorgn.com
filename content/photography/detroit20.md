Looks super random, but actually we planned this trip to see a Larry June concert
and shoot in the city.  Little did we know this would be our last trip under "normal"
circumstances.  We left Pittsburgh on 3/13/2020.  Right at the beginning of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  When we left Pittsburgh everything was normal, but by the time
we got to Detroit everything was shut down and we found out the concert was cancelled
we already drove all the way there so we made it as fun as we could.  
<br>
I'd say it was still a good time.
