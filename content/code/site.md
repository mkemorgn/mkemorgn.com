title = "Super complex website"
+++

After I finished a coding bootcamp in December I decided that my first solo project
would be a portfolio website for my code, then I decided it would be a portfolio
project for my photos, then I was like: "well this is going to be a lot of work
and money to maintain these sites." So, I decided on just a photography website
that I built with VueJs on the front end and Express in the backend.  I learned 
alot building the site but it was just growing and growing, becoming more and 
more bloated and I didn't want to deal with it anymore.  I still have the source 
code on my GitHub so I can laugh at it in a few years.

This site was built using Zola which is a static site generator written in Rust.
Very simple and fun process.  The goal is to make a website that houses stuff
that I want people to see, but I don't want it to be big, slow and bloated.
My philosophy is to make things as lightweight as possible.
