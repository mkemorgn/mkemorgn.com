This is all my favorite linux software and how I've configured it.  Not everything
here really requires a lot of skill but it's fun to tinker with and figured i'd
throw it up here to let other people use/critique.

- qtile: My favorite window manager. This is home for me currently.
- vim: My favorite text editor, I do 99% of my editing here.
- doom emacs: My second favorite text editor.
- alacritty: My favorite terminal emulator. Heard it was the fastest I took their word for it.
- fish shell: Bash is still my default shell system wide but I use the fish shell the most.
- rofi: My favorite launcher. I keep mine simple.

Currently, I'm trying to learn rust so I have started on the penrose window manager,
but I haven't made it very far yet. Any rust advice/ code reviews would be great.

- [vim repo](https://github.com/mkemorgn/vim-config)
- [doom emacs repo](https://github.com/mkemorgn/.doom.d)  
<br>
I keep all of these up to date so if you're just starting out then maybe this
could help get you started.

My daily setup.
