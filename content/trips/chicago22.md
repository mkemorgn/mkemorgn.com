I was initially not excited about going to Chicago, mostly because of the time of the year (March).  But It was for Lombe's birthday so I just went along with it.  

The city was beautiful, and we ended up having decent weather.  The last couple days we were there we were wearing short sleeves.  

Some highlights of this trip were: the architecture cruise, Lou Malnati's pizza, and the burger from Au Cheval.  I recommend all of these.  

Overall I enjoyed the trip and Chicago is one of my favorite cities now.
