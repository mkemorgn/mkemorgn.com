Came to Boston for a work trip.  I stayed a little south of downtown, and these images are all from my 20 minute commute (walk) to work.  

Boston is a pretty decent city, I enjoyed my time here, I just wish I had more time with my camera to explore but I guess that just means I have a reason to come back.  

Most of these images are from Chinatown which was one of the more interesting Chinatown neighborhoods that I've ever been in.  It was a really different experience from neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.  

Overall, the rest of Boston really reminded me of Pittsburgh a lot so scenes felt familiar to me.  

These were my favorites from my walk(s).
