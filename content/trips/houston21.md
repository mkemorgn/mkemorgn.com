This was a work trip to do some training.  I got there on Sunday evening, when I woke up Monday morning to see where to go and what time to get there I saw messages saying the person teaching the class got covid, so they cancelled class and told us to enjoy Houston.  

Houston is probably my favorite city, besides San Diego of course.
