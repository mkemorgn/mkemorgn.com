This trip to LA was great for me.  The reason for the trip was to help my brother in law with a shoot he was doing for his clothing line.  He rented a studio and we shot with a couple models there.  It was an experience. 

I lived in California for 4 years, but I left in 2016 so it felt great to be back there after so much time away.  It was also great to catch up with some old friends. 

I wish I had more time to shoot in LA looking back on my time there I could've shot more, I was just so caught up with seeing old friends and then doing this shoot.  But I'm sure I'll be back with the sole purpose of shooting because there was some neighborhoods I need to walk around in.

This is the summary.
