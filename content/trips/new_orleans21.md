New Orleans was on my list of cities to visit for a while.  I've always felt like one of the only people in my circle of friends who hasn't been.  

We wanted to see Dave Chappelle and dates lined up for the closing show of the tour in New Orleans at the Smoothie King arena.  The line up was perfect: Donnell Rawlings, Tom Segura, Joe Rogan, and Dave Chappelle.  It was great to see all these people live who I never thought I'd actually see in person.  

We probably didn't have the best timing on visiting the city, there was just a hurricane a few weeks prior and a lot of stuff was closed, the overall vibe there just wasn't what I was expecting.  Also, surprisingly the food wasn't that great either.  

The architecture of the buildings there was probably the most interesting thing to me.
